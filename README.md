# R&D system meant to become a reusable microservice framework

This system implements a SEO-Planner. It helps managing our SEO. The system links pages and their website. 
The user can decide on meta data for a given website using this application. Once the SEO data are set, these data can be shared with an API  

## How is the system designed?

### Overview
This system is designed in the same way as its project's sibling (the task planner)

## Other thoughts

### Deployment
I use AWS/PM2 and a ssh script at the moment

### Roadmap
- to add test coverage using either cypress or jest
- to use Docker/Kubernetes in CI/CD method
